#Customer Relationship Manager
##By Alec Hannaford

-----

A CRM that keeps track of customers, and reminds you when to do so.

###Features
- When an entry is made for a user, have a record of the active session's username associated and displayed with each entry or change. (Could we use req.session.username for this?)
- CRUD user records
- User photos
- Keep track of the date of last contact w/ customer. So we know if and when they start to "run cold".
- Filter views for our home index page. So we can filter for specific customers (age, location, etc..)
